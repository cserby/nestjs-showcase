# Weather service

## Challenge input

Use [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) from a backend service (preferred language up to you).
Fetch weather every minute and store in a database of your choice.

Example with payload
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=44.34&lon=10.99&appid=c808c3b5ad219bada7b3b3857e721b10

There is a lot of data in the payload, but temperature is what we are looking for.
