# The challenge

Build a high-level list of solution components, capabilities, and conceptual architecture that you consider important for an IIoT platform. You may refer to the IIoT and Edge platform reference
architectures online for guidance in this endeavor.

Establish strong engineering practices as part of the build process. What core engineering and DevSecOps practices do you think are important to build a robust platform?

How will you, as a software engineer, assist in setting the team for success. What will your focus be, and how do you intend to contribute to the teamâ€™s success?

The challenges can be summarized as the following:

1. There is a requirement to develop a new manufacturing platform that facilitates standardization for deploying applications across Manufacturing Facilities.

1. The lack of a standardized manufacturing edge platform hinders innovation teams from rapidly testing their AI and ML solutions.

3. The team is relatively small and struggles with operations of the current scope, ensuring DevSecOps, automation and strong monitoring capabilities to reduce workload from the team.

# Sample Exercise

Below are a few of examples of exercises. We would like you to look at one of them and create a solution in the form of source code.

 * An application that lists all IIoT devices and their current state (current status online/offline, software version, last reported datetime, etc.)
 * An application or API for fetching device sensor telemetry events
 * An application or API for updating changes to device states
 * An application for displaying historical changes in device status
